Linus Torvalds
is a Finnishâ€“Sweden software engineer who is the creator,
and historically, the principal developer of the Linux kernel.
He also created the distributed revision control system Git
and the diving logging and planning software Subsurface.

The Linux kernel is an open-source monolithic Unix-like computer operating system kernel.
The Linux family of operating systems is based on this kernel and deployed
on both traditional computer systems such as personal computers and servers,
and on various embedded devices such as routers, wireless access points, smart TVs, etc.

The Linux Foundation is the nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.
Founded in 2007, the Linux Foundation sponsors the work of Linux creator Linus Torvalds
and is supported by leading technology companies and developers from around the world.
The Linux Foundation promotes, protects and advances Linux by marshaling the resources of
its members and the open source development community to ensure Linux remains free and technically advanced.

Linus:
C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot
of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much
easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if
the choice of C were to do *nothing* but keep the C++ programmers out,
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.
